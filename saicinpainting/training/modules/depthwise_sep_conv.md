- Normal convolution layer of a neural network involve (input_channel * kernel_width * kernel_height * output_channel) parameters. Having too much parameters increases the chance of over-fitting.

## Normal Convolution
- In this convolution, we apply a 2-d depth filter at each depth level of input tensor. Lets understand this through an example. Suppose our input tensor is 8x8x3. Filter is 3x3x3. In a standard convolution we would directly convolve in depth dimension as well. You would require three 3-channel filters if you would use normal convolution.
- Number of parameters: 3 * (3x3x3) = 81

## Depth-wise Convolution
- In depth-wise convolution, we use each filter channel only at one input channel. In the example, we have 3 channel filter and 3 channel image. What we do is — break the filter and image into three different channels and then convolve the corresponding image with corresponding channel and then stack them back.

- To produce same effect with normal convolution, what we need to do is - select a channel, make all the elements zero in the filter except that channel and then convolve. We will need three different filters — one for each channel.
- Number of parameters: 3 * (3x3) = 27

## Depth-wise Separable Convolution
- We perform depth-wise convolution and after that we use a 1x1 filter to cover the depth dimension (point-wise convolution).

- One thing to notice is, how much parameters are reduced by this convolution to output same no. of channels.
- Number of parameters: 3 * (3x3) + 3 * (1x3) = 36
- Having too many parameters forces function to memorize lather than learn and thus over-fitting. Depth-wise separable convolution saves us from that.
